I am Oscar A. B. Orellana and I design, author and maintain open source projects written in Golang.

Since 2022 I work full-time as Co-Founder at Nuntio, a Dasnish statup building an open source cloud development platform on Kubernetes. We provide the ease-of-use of traditional platforms like Firebase and Heroku, coupled with the flexibility and complexity offered by Kubernetes.
