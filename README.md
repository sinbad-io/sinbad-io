My hacker name (Sinbad) is from my favorite character in The Count of Monte Cristo.

My real name is Oscar A. B. Orellana, and from May 2022 to August 2023, I worked full-time as CEO and Co-Founder at Nuntio (now Rig.dev). We built an open-source application development platform on Kubernetes, combining the ease-of-use of traditional platforms like Firebase and Heroku, coupled with the flexibility and complexity offered by Kubernetes.

I currently work at Corti as a Senior Platform Engineer, where I focus on building out the platform and tools for managing multiple Kubernetes environments, supporting customers all around the world.
