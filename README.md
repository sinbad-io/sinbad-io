My hacker name (Sinbad) is from my favorite character in The Count of Monte Cristo. 

My real name is Oscar A. B. Orellana and I design, author and maintain open source projects, primarily written in Golang.

From May 2022 to August 2023 I worked full-time as CEO and Co-Founder at Nuntio (now Rig.dev), a Dasnish statup building an open source development platform on Kubernetes. We combined the ease-of-use of traditional platforms like Firebase and Heroku, coupled with the flexibility and complexity offered by Kubernetes.
