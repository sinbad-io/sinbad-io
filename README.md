From May 2022 to August 2023, I worked full-time as CEO and Co-Founder at Nuntio (now Rig.dev), where I helped design and built an open-source application development platform on Kubernetes, combining the ease-of-use of traditional platforms like Heroku, coupled with the flexibility and complexity offered by Kubernetes.

I currently work at Corti as a Senior Platform Engineer, where I focus on building out the platform and tools for managing multiple Kubernetes environments, supporting customers all around the world.
